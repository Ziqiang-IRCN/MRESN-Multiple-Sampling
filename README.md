# MRESN-Sequence-Resampling-NTP
A sample demo code of Multi-Reservoir Echo State Networks with Sequence Resampling for Nonlinear Time-series Prediction

You will find three simple demos for DeepESN-ESR, DeepESN-LSR, and GroupedESN-ISR on the MGS-17 dataset.
These code can complete the prediction task of MGS-17 but are not well-optimized.
